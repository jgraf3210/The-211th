# The-211th-
Senior Project Stock Analysis 

This was a Senior Project for my college group

The project was designed to be a webapp that would use machine learning to predict EOD stock prices using a Linear Regression model.The software stack consisted of Flask and Django for the front end and backend. 

The webapp was initially hosted on on a AWS server and had the database information hosted on a Microsoft Azure database.

The code is being edited to have a local SQLite database to host information and to use an API from AlphaVantage to manage updating and maintaining the EOD infmrmation on the selected stocks.
